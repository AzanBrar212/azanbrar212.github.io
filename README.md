## Work Experience

**Research Associate @ Multifunctional Material Systems Laboratory (_Jan 2019 - Jan 2023_)**

Worked on two main projects over my time:

Autonomous Reactors						
- Programmed algorithms in Python and LabVIEW to automate large-scale data collection and analysis for Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) data and injection pumps. 
- Built Machine learning regression models in Python to analyze a wide range of FTIR spectral data for ethanol production, drastically reducing experimental resources, labor, and time.

Membrane Electrode Catalysis 				                   	
- Designed electrochemical fuel cells for a new Nylon 6,6 manufacturing plant funded by the H&M foundation in efforts to accelerate sustainable fashion. 
- Researched unique heavy metal catalysts for organic electrosynthesis of Hexamethylenediamine from Adiponitrile, removing the need for fossil fuel use in polymer material production to reach the carbon-neutral goals of the foundation.

**Head Instructor @ Polytechnic Tutoring Centre, NYU (_Sept 2017 - Dec 2022_)**

- Formulated comprehensive written exams to evaluate the skills of prospective tutors. Additionally conducted various review sessions for all engineering courses. 
- Administered the hiring of new instructors and facilitated tutoring for General Chemistry, Biomolecular Science, Organic Chemistry, Transport Phenomena and Thermodynamics

**Teaching Assistant @ Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, NYU (_Sept 2017 - Dec 2020_)**

- Process Design for Engineering Unit Operations: Led groups of 25 students on principles of process design for industrial-scale manufacturing, supervised experiments on the operations of industrial components such as pump flow controls, distillation columns, and stirred tank reactor kinetics.
- Business and Technology Seminar: Lectured cohorts of 20 students every semester on the principles of design thinking, innovative problem solving, lean manufacturing, start-up methodologies, and iterative processes. Supervised the prototyping and design of semester-long engineering projects. 


#### Technical Skills: Python, MATLAB, LabVIEW, Java, PyTorch, SQL, R-Studio, HTML, COMSOL Multiphysics

## Technical Projects

**Design Projects**

### Vanadium Micro-Redox Flow Battery   

- Researched and designed a chemical microfluidic reactor for a vanadium redox flow battery, providing an operational, scalable and low cost alternative to produce competitive power levels.
- Using COMSOL Multiphysics and computational fluid dynamics, the vanadium flow battery was conceptualized able to achieve current densities around 30mA/cm2 higher than standard.
  
### Membrane-less Electrochemical Reactor

- Designed a bifurcated channel electrochemical reactor for higher production rates of chlorine and carbon monoxide.
- Optimized reactor collection efficiencies of over 99.9% at a reactor height of 0.019 cm using COMSOL Multiphysics.
 
**Software Projects**

### Computational Biology for DNA sequencing 

- Generated string-matching algorithms in Python using the concepts of dynamic programming, which were utilized to identify mismatches between sets of DNA strands that lead to dangerous mutations.
- Tested various sorting algorithms in Python to differentiate genome sequences for mutations across multiple species, helping to identify patterns in DNA to predict possible disease variations before they arise.

### Nanoparticle self-assembly simulation 

- Used Boltzmann probability distributions to develop Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations in MATLAB describing the self-assembled crystal structures in a set of nanoparticles.
- Resultant model was used to optimize the lowest energy state, decreasing the energy cost for nanoparticle assembly by tenfold.
